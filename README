A read-only S3 Object/Bucket browser JRuby Rails App inspired by the
Firefox s3:// plugin. I loved using the browser's address bar to navigate
S3 virtual directories, but needed a way to seamlessly support multiple
S3 accounts without re-configuring on the fly.

You'll need to configure your S3 account(s) credentials by creating the
following file:

<ROOT>/config/s3.yml

In the form of:

<account_name>:
  aws_access_key_id:<access key id>
  aws_secret_access_key:<access key>

Example:

dev:
  aws_access_key_id:<access key id>
  aws_secret_access_key:<access key>

prod:
  aws_access_key_id:<access key id>
  aws_secret_access_key:<access key>

Do this for each account you'd like accessible for browsing.

To package, run the following from <ROOT>:

$ jruby -S bundle install
$ warble

Which produces a .war file named "s3.war". Grab this and deploy to
your favorite servlet container. Navigate to:

http://your-server-name-here/s3

And you'll see a listing of the account(s) you configured in s3.yml.
Select an account and you'll see the bucket(s) for that account. Select
a bucket and you'll see the object(s) and common prefixes for that bucket.
You get the idea, browse away....
